This repository contains a detection model and supporting datasets for identifying suspicious accounts involved in potential drug-selling activities on encrypted messaging platforms. The project includes a web-based interface that allows input of user metadata (e.g., chat counts, SIM swaps, reports, media ratios) and outputs a risk classification for suspected accounts. The datasets are fully synthetic and are designed to support research, testing, and training of AI/ML models in cybersecurity and illicit activity detection.
